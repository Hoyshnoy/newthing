    <h2>1954 Mercury Monterey Sport Coupe</h2>
    <p>This stunning 1954 Mercury Monterey Sport Coupe features its beautiful factory red and white exterior paired with a matching red and white interior. Mercury unleashed major technology upgrades that year, introducing the indestructible Y-block overhead valve engine. The ride, handling, and steering were vastly improved with newly designed tie rods, ball joints, and a smooth-riding front suspension. Mercury’s designers were light years ahead with aerodynamic styling, a low roofline, and a finless sweeping tail end. Inside, you’ll find pilot-in-command T-handled sliding controls and a smaller, sportier steering wheel for a true cockpit feel of comfort and control. This car has had a ground-up restoration that brings it to a new level, including power front disc brakes, Coker radials with the correct whitewall width, and a fully restored radio upgraded with a concealed CD player and front and rear speakers.</p>
