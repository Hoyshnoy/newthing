    <h2>1954 Mercury Monterey Sport Coupe</h2>
    <p>1954 Mercury 
Sport Coupe, beautiful factory red and white exterior and matching red and white interior.
Mercury unleashed a slew of technology upgrades in 1954, with the introduction of the indestructible Y-block Overhead Valve engine.
The better ride, better handling and steering with newly designed tie rods, ball joints and smooth riding front suspension.
The Mercury designers were light years ahead in their styling with its aerodynamic body, low low roofline and finless sweeping tail end.
The interior was also a marvel with pilot-in-command T-handled sliding controls.
With a smaller sportier steering wheel, that gave the cockpit the feel of comfort and control.
This car has had a ground up restoration several years ago that brings this car to a new level. With the addition of power front disc brakes, Coker radials with the correct whitewall width.
Radio restoration and upgrade with concealed CD Player and front and rear speakers.</p>
